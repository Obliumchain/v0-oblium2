# Database Scripts

## Important: Script Execution Order

Run these scripts in numerical order for a fresh database setup.

## Referral System

The referral system is implemented in **026_final_referral_fix.sql**. This is the most recent and correct version.

**Previous versions (now removed):**
- ~~014_create_referral_rewards_function.sql~~ (outdated - removed)
- ~~021_update_referral_rewards.sql~~ (outdated - removed)
- ~~022_fix_referral_system.sql~~ (outdated - removed)

If you've already run the old scripts in your Supabase database, simply run **026_final_referral_fix.sql** to replace them with the correct version.

## Current Active Scripts

All scripts numbered 001-026 (excluding the removed ones) are the current active version and should be run in order for a complete database setup.
